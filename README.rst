=============================
 Exception Parser and Emailer
=============================

Simple Text File Parser


Reasons
=======
A certain coworker tends to catch certain Exceptions in their python code.
Wrapped it and just have it emailed which then it got to big for him
to care. I wrote this to parse the email to help organize and help debug/fix
each Exception being thrown and not caught.

Basically a good example of a Parser using Scala's Regex.
